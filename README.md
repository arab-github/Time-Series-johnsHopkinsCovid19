# Time-Series-forecasting-johnsHopkinsCovid19

## Overview

This project focuses on time series forecasting for COVID-19 data provided by Johns Hopkins University. The goal is to develop machine learning models that can predict the future trends of COVID-19 cases, deaths, or other relevant metrics. The models are built using historical data to aid in understanding and potentially predicting the impact of the pandemic.

## Business Case

The primary objective is to provide accurate predictions of COVID-19 trends, assisting healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the public in making informed decisions. By leveraging time series forecasting, this project aims to contribute valuable insights for managing and mitigating the impact of the ongoing pandemic.

## Data Information

The dataset includes daily updates on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries across countries and regions. Features may include geographical information, population density, healthcare infrastructure, and other relevant factors influencing the spread of the virus.

## Problem Statement

The primary challenge is to build robust time series forecasting models that can accurately predict the future trajectory of COVID-19 cases. This involves handling seasonality, incorporating external factors, and providing interpretable results to guide decision-making.

## Approach

1. **Data Collection:** Gather daily COVID-19 data from reliable sources, such as Johns Hopkins University.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explore the data to identify patterns, trends, and potential factors influencing the spread of the virus.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Create relevant features, such as lag variables or rolling averages, to capture temporal dependencies.
5. **Model Selection:** Experiment with various time series forecasting models, including ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.
7. **Visualization:** Create informative visualizations to communicate insights and predictions effectively.
